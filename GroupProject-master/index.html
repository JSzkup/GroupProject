             The Department of Accounting, Taxation and Legal Studies in Business at the Frank G. Zarb School of Business provides students with a strong foundation in the classroom (including a focus on CPA licensure requirements), as well as practical experience through internships, community service and student clubs. </p>
             
             <p>Our faculty are distinguished scholars from diverse backgrounds who have top-level executive experience and a passion for passing on what they know - seven have received Hofstra University's highest award for teaching.</p> 
             
             <p>Our program is the only one in Long Island with the elite AACSB accounting accreditation. Students in accounting and legal studies are encouraged to take advantage of opportunities to apply what they are learning outside the classroom, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="bul">
            	<li>Dynamic student clubs, pre-professional organizations and honor societies whose members regularly place at national competitions</li>
            	<li>Peer tutoring and community service projects such as VITA â€“ Voluntary Income Tax Assistance, in which students help local residents with tax preparation. It is one of the largest university-run income tax assistance programs in the nation.</li>
            	<li>Prestigious internships with top-tier companies, thanks to our proximity to New York City, our strong alumni network and an advisory board of high-powered global business executives.</li>
